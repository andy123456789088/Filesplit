# Filesplit
You can split a file into more little files, e.g. for transfer large files over CD.
Now you can use big files too. Currently the size of the particullary files can be maximal 500 MB.
For instance, you can split a 8 GB-file into 16 files. But, if the size is greather than 8192 MB,
you get 17 files.
